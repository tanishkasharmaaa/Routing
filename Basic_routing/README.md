## Problem

## Understanding Component Structure

- App
  - Home (should be rendedered on default route "/")
  - About (should be rendered on route "/about")
  - Contact (should be rendered on route "/contact")
  - Products (should be rendered on route "/products")

**Note** - `Make sure you use only the given components and dont create new files and folders. Changing component name, structures might result in giving you zero marks.`


## Features to build

1. Create a navbar which has the following links (should have the same order as below)
   - Home
   - About
   - Contact
   - Products
   
2. Clicking on the navbar link should redirect the user to that component and update url at the same time
3. Navbar component should be visible on every page
4. Fetch the products data from the given API, and show the user all the products data on "/products" page
   - API: ```https://dbioz2ek0e.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mockapi/get-products```

## General Instructions (**_IMPORTANT_**)

1. Do not use Global CSS, instead use `<componentName>.module.css` convention for Css in that file.
2. Do Not Remove `data-cy="xxxx"` from anywhere, this are used by testing tools to test your code, removal of this will lead to low score.
3. Make sure you use only the given components and dont create new files and folders as chaging component name, structures might result in giving you zero marks

**Note** - This might not be all the things, you are free to use other components.
